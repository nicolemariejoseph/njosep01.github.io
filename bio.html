<h3> Njosep01 Bio</h3> 
<p> 

I would say I am a pretty collected person on the outside that has a lot of motivation and fire on the inside. I lead a pretty busy life because I like to commit myself fully to everything I do, and everything I do is meditated and thought out. I am certainly a person-centered being and spend a bulk of my time communicating with people in person or on the phone. We often communicate about the work we do together, but I also like to understand where people are at emotionally and what their capacity is so that I can know how to think about my teams collectively, call on people if they have more capacity, or figure out how to plug others in if they need support. Most of what I spend my time doing at Tufts is organizing with the groups I reference on my resume (Tufts Labor Coalition and Students for Justice in Palestine), working in the dining halls, doing schoolwork, and doing my house duties for the co-op I live in. I think one thing to know about me is that I am patient and persistent and have a lot of stamina; I like committing to the communities I am part of for the long haul and working to leverage my position and the powers I hold in any place. My initial interest in organizing and social justice was the early awareness I had of power dynamics that existed in my own life and dynamics I saw in the world around me.  I always tried to mediate conflicts around me from a young age, not really having many myself both because of the strong interpersonal relationships I had with everyone I interacted with and the ways I did not feel the need to stand up for myself. As I continued along my childhood trying to mediate conflicts between people of all age groups, I started to gather there were other forces and dynamics at playâ€”forces I would now call systems of oppression. As I have continued to grow in my political consciousness and be able to identify these systems and the players in them, I have been able to think about and participate in organizing against these targets. I have been able to recognize the nuanced place I hold in these systems and understand why I do not want to be a part of exploitation or be exploited. I absolutely believe in a bottom up community-based model of change and work to enact that model into reality and support structures already in place using that theory of change. I have geared my education towards understanding these systems of oppression and gaining skills to dismantle them. I am working more concretely on the later goal in my education now through learning about and participating in community-based research and initiatives, programing, GIS, Spanish, and Portuguese. I am still learning how to build sustainable movements and how to build organizing structures that also exist and thrive and exist without the glue constant of escalation.  I think that my preferred organizing style includes both building relationships and leaders along with balanced and participatory escalation.
